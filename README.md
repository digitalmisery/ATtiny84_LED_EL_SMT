ATtiny84 LED + EL (SMT)
=======================
This is a miniaturized version of my other [ATtiny84 LED + EL](http://github.com/digitalmisery/ATtiny84_LED_EL)
board. It uses mainly surface-mount components which allowed me to shrink it down to 1.0" x 1.0".
This is the version that ultimately made it into my [Valentine Love Light](http://www.digitalmisery.com/projects/valentines-day/valentine-love-light/).

The PCB is shared on [OSH Park](http://oshpark.com/shared_projects/lLCQlTCR).
